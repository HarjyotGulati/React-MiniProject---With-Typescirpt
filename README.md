# React Hooks with TypeScript

This project demonstrates how to use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, and `useRef`) with TypeScript. It also includes an example of passing props to a functional component.

## Features
- **useState**: Manages component state.
- **useEffect**: Handles side effects.
- **useContext**: Uses context API to share data.
- **useReducer**: Implements state management with a reducer function.
- **useRef**: References DOM elements.
- **Props**: Demonstrates how to pass and use props in a functional component.
